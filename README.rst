Serial-Wio
==========

Turn your WioTerminal into an automagic UART terminal !

Features
--------

* Automatic baudrate/parity detection
* On-screen UART log
* USB UART bridge

Custom case
-----------

A custom case has been designed to fit the WioTerminal, it allows normal multimeter probes
to be used and protects the electronics.

The case is made of 3 independent parts that may be 3d printed with any decent 3d printer.

Custom PCB
----------

We designed a custom PCB that extends WioTerminal capabilities designed with KiCAD v5.
Design files are available in `PCB_design_files` folder, including 3D models and custom
fingerprints.

Gerber files are also provided in the `PCB_design_files/gerber` directory, as well as the
`kicad_pcb` file if you want to order it on OSHPark.
